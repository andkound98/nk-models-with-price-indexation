# New Keynesian Models with Price Indexation
Here, I collect my attempts at including price indexation into the small- and medium-scale New Keynesian models provided by the `econpizza` package by Gregor BÃ¶hl, PhD.

## Small-Scale NK 
With the run_nk_price_indexation.py file you can get the inflation impulse response functions of the small-scale (!) model without and with price indexation and plot the results in one window to compare. This code runs withouth problem. I hope I did nothing wrong here...

## Medium-Scale Nk
This one I haven't figured out, as you can see by just running the standard `econpizza` code for the yaml file with price indexation in the medium_scale_nk file. You can see what I came up with so far in that yaml file. I do not really see what I do wrong when implementing price indexation into this model, as I try to follow the steps I took when doing it for the small-scale model. If you have any ideas or corrections, please let me know!
