# New Keynesian Models with Price Indexation
Here, I collect my attempts at including price indexation into the small- and medium-scale New Keynesian models provided by the `econpizza` package by Gregor BÃ¶hl, PhD.

## Small-Scale NK 
With the run_nk_price_indexation.py file you can get inflation impulse response functions of the model without and with price indexation and plot the results in one window to compare.

## Medium-Scale Nk
This one I haven't figured out yet (you can see my progress in the respective yaml file under the medium_scale_nk file), most likely because I do something wrong when implementing price indexation into this model. If you have any ideas or corrections, let me know!
