# New Keynesian Models with Price Indexation
In this small repository, I collect my attempts at including price indexation into the small- and medium-scale New Keynesian (NK) models provided by the [`econpizza` package](https://github.com/gboehl/econpizza) by Gregor BÃ¶hl, PhD.

## Small-Scale NK 
With the `run_nk_price_indexation.py` file you can get the inflation impulse response functions of the small-scale NK model without and with price indexation (the respective yaml files are in the `small_scale_nk` file) and plot the results to compare.

## Medium-Scale Nk
With the `run_med_scale_nk_price_indexation.py` file you similarly obtain the responses of the medium-scale NK model without and with price indexation.

In case you spot an error, please let me know!
